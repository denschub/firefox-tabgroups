Simplified Tab Groups for Firefox
=================================

**NOTE**: This project is currently unmaintained. If someone wants to take over, [check this discussion](https://github.com/denschub/firefox-tabgroups/issues/60#issuecomment-388541616) and drop me a note.

---

This project aims to provide a simple add-on to replace some functionalities
from TabView/Tab Groups/Panorama which were removed from Firefox due to a lot
of open bugs and a very low overall usage.

Installation
------------

The add-on is available at [addons.mozilla.org][amo] and should be installed
there to ensure the add-on stays updated.

Warning
-------

Please note that this extension is currently in a very unstable and untested
state and may kill your tabs or small kittens. While it may get improved and
secured in the future, I strongly advise you to make a backup of your important
tabs...

Building
--------

Assuming you have Node.js v5 installed on your machine, building this project
is rather easy.

1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Run `./node_modules/.bin/jake build` to build all source files into the
   `dist/` directory or run `./node_modules/.bin/jake run` to build the add-on
   and start a Firefox instance for testing.

`jake run` uses `jpm` and you can pass additional parameters to it by setting
an environment variable, for example: `JPM_PARAMS="-b nightly" jake run`

Contributing
------------

Feel free to [fix some open issues][issues] and submit a pull request. Please
make sure to file the pull request against the `develop` branch, which should
be the default. Please make sure your code passes the coding styleguides by
running `jake lint` before submitting the PR.

If you want to help translating this add-on, feel free to alter or add new
files in `src/locale`. The extensions name and descriptions have to be changed
in `src/install.rdf`.
